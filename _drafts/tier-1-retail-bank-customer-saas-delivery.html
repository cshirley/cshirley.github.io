<p>Over the past the 10 months I have led  the engineering and operational teams that delivered a new Small Buisness customer focused SaaS products for a couple of Tier 1 retail banks.  A huge amount of time &amp; technical effort has been spent directly integrating with the bank's account opening/on-boarding systems along with engineering areas of the product to support a true white-labeled, scalable SaaS platform that meets the necessary security and regulatory banking requirements. while remaining flexible and useful to our end-customers.</p>
<p>But this is just hard work, with delivery being the most exciting aspect of the overall process.   Yet the real challenges one faced was bridging the divide between two fundamentally different organisations both in size culture and expectations.  Wading through external processes, shaping our internal procedures, much of which was not scoped for in the original tender(s), project planning and general scoping of the commercial offering.</p>
<p>When engaged as an external consultant/contractor you are placed in a unique/privilege position when delivering solutions for your client's customers.  Often one is viewed as an independent/semi-impartial party, which in itself has a number of moral challenges (particularly when you have to justify yourself as an expense during the project).</p>
<h4><strong>Context</strong></h4>
<p>In this particular instance I was dropped into the fray at the beginning of September 2014.  Tensions were running high due to previous frictions relationships and expectations around a successful delivery were low.   Last minute specification changes were coming thick and fast and I was responsible for a relatively inexperience engineering team using a technical stack brought in by contractors which was at odds with the experience of the permanent engineering staff.  The odds were definitely stacked against us as we had 100's of defects, new functionality, no test automation (aside from an off-shore team whom execute manual test scripts) and a product that fundamentally did not work due to the over complexity of the system architecture along with many third-party integrations.</p>
<h4>Product</h4>
<p>Essentially the main USP of this solution is a cost saving for Banking Customers, while consolidating all of their operational needs into a single-sign-on portal with best-of-breed products selected by the respective banks.</p>
