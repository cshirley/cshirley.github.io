<p>I have been locked in a dark room for the last 3 weeks building out a new API which opens up access to the social analytics generated by our platform providing real time social analytics including sentiment, volume and trending for major US/UK securities and FX pairs in JSON format.  This has come about after many requests from our existing (and potential) customers to open up our technology stack for integration purposes</p>
<p>The API is free for personal use and provides a very cost effective way to experiment with the data, increasing the cost, only as your usage increases.  Documentation link is <a title="here" href="http://www.ftsee.com/api/documentation" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>This is a version <strong>1.0 beta release,</strong> while we fine tune performance, scaleability and functional scope. We hope to iterate fast which requires considerable input from our existing eco-system of users.</p>
<p>Thus if you don't ask for features you won't get them - so ask away !</p>

<p>So what does our API provide ?</p>
<ul>
<li>Key Technicals focus on the social data we pull from twitter an other media</li>
<li>Analytics on URLs</li>
<li>Social Relevance</li>
<li>Rest/Streaming access</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the same APIs on which our social dashboard is developed with, so you can start embedding live streams and social charting within your LOB applications today !</p>
